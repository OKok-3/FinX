Code organization is thus based on CLEAN architecture layers, with package names representing each layer. As this will be a web application, it's separated into two main packages: `frontend` and `backend`:
* `backend` -- hosts all relevant files for backend development, packaged by CLEAN architecture layers
* `frontend` -- hosts all relevant files for frontend development, packaged by CLEAN architecture layers

## Progress
### Version 0
Right now, the program is in its initialization phase, implementing and developing basic business logics. This program will closely adhere to CLEAN architecture and SOLID design principle for code organizaiton.
